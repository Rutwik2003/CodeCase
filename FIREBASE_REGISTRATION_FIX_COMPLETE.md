# Firebase Registration Error Fix Report
**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
User was experiencing Firebase registration errors when creating new accounts, specifically:
- Error: `Function setDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field referredBy)`
- Registration process failing for new users
- Invalid argument errors in Firestore

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was in the `AuthContext.tsx` file where the `referredBy` field was being set to `undefined` when no referral code was provided during registration. Firestore does not accept `undefined` values and requires either a valid value or the field to be omitted entirely.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Undefined Field Values ✅
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
**Change:** Modified the `initialUserData` object creation to conditionally include the `referredBy` field only when a referral code is provided.

**Before:**
```typescript
referredBy: referralCode  // This could be undefined
```

**After:**
```typescript
...(referralCode && { referredBy: referralCode })  // Only include if referralCode exists
```

### 2. Added Data Sanitization Function ✅
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
**Added:** Utility function to remove undefined values from objects before Firestore operations.

```typescript
const sanitizeForFirestore = (obj: any): any => {
  const cleaned: any = {};
  Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => {
    if (obj[key] !== undefined) {
      if (obj[key] && typeof obj[key] === 'object' && obj[key].constructor === Object) {
        cleaned[key] = sanitizeForFirestore(obj[key]);
      } else {
        cleaned[key] = obj[key];
      }
    }
  });
  return cleaned;
};
```

### 3. Updated Document Creation Process ✅
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
**Change:** Modified the `setDoc` call to sanitize data before sending to Firestore.

```typescript
const sanitizedData = sanitizeForFirestore(initialUserData);
await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', user.uid), sanitizedData);
```

### 4. Fixed Environment Configuration ✅
**File:** `.env`
**Changes:**
- Updated `VITE_APP_URL` from `https://codecase.appwrite.network` to `https://codecase.rutwikdev.com`
- Added `VITE_DOMAIN=codecase.rutwikdev.com` configuration

## Firebase Configuration Verification ✅

### 1. Authentication Status
- ✅ Firebase CLI authenticated successfully
- ✅ Project set to `codebuster-82940`
- ✅ All Firebase environment variables validated

### 2. Firestore Setup
- ✅ Security rules deployed and active
- ✅ Database accessible and functional
- ✅ All existing user data cleared (as requested)

### 3. Environment Validation
- ✅ All required environment variables present
- ✅ Firebase configuration valid
- ✅ Domain configuration correct

## Testing Results ✅

### 1. Firebase Connection Test
- ✅ Successfully created test user
- ✅ Successfully created Firestore document
- ✅ No undefined field errors
- ✅ Document creation and deletion working

### 2. Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No build errors or warnings
- ✅ All imports and types valid

### 3. Development Server
- ✅ Server starts successfully on localhost:5173
- ✅ Application loads without errors

## Security Notes 🔒

### Current Firestore Rules
- Rules allow read/write access until August 9, 2025
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper security rules before production deployment

### Data Sanitization
- Added automatic removal of undefined values
- Prevents future Firestore validation errors
- Maintains data integrity

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Test Registration Flow:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   - Test user registration with and without referral codes
   - Verify Firestore documents are created correctly

2. **Monitor for Issues:**
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Verify user data appears correctly in Firebase Console

3. **Production Preparation:**
   - Update Firestore security rules for production
   - Test with real user accounts
   - Verify email verification flow if implemented

## Files Modified 📁

1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed undefined field handling and added sanitization
2. `.env` - Updated domain configuration
3. Firebase project configuration verified and cleaned

## Command Summary 💻

```powershell
# Environment validation
npm run validate-env

# Firebase setup
firebase login --reauth
firebase use codebuster-82940
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase firestore:delete --recursive users

# Build and test
npm run build
npm run dev
```
