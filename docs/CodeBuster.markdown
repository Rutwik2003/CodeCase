# CodeBuster: A Detective-Themed Coding Game

## Concept Overview
CodeBuster is a detective-themed game that teaches basic HTML/CSS skills through crime-solving missions. Players are web detectives who use HTML/CSS to fix broken websites to uncover clues, guided by an AI-powered partner. The game uses a retro, pixel-art aesthetic to make coding feel like solving a mystery.

## Learning Objectives
- **HTML/CSS Basics**: Learn tags, styles, and layouts (e.g., divs, flexbox, basic styling).
- **Problem-Solving**: Apply coding skills to fix real-world-like web issues.
- **Creativity**: Experiment with CSS to create visually appealing solutions.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Missions**: Players complete 4–6 cases, each requiring fixing a broken webpage (e.g., misaligned divs, wrong colors) to reveal a clue.
- **Code Editor**: A simple, in-game editor lets players write or drag-and-drop HTML/CSS to fix issues.
- **AI Partner**: An AI-powered detective provides hints and explains HTML/CSS concepts, using natural language processing.
- **Progression**: Earn “Clue Points” for fixing pages, unlocking new cases and cosmetic badges.
- **Replay Value**: Randomized web issues and styling options encourage replay.

## Technical Implementation
- **Platform**: Built with Bolt.new for scenes and React for the code editor.
- **AI Integration**: Use Claude AI for the partner’s contextual hints and explanations.
- **Visuals**: Retro pixel-art detective office with animated screens, created with Pixilart, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Hosting**: Deploy on GitHub Pages.
- **Development Plan (20 Days)**:
  - **Days 1–3**: Design 4–6 cases, define HTML/CSS issues, and sketch UI.
  - **Days 4–7**: Create pixel-art assets and build scenes in Bolt.new.
  - **Days 8–12**: Implement editor in React and AI partner with Claude API.
  - **Days 13–16**: Add animations (e.g., flickering screens), sound effects (e.g., typewriter clicks), and polish UI.
  - **Days 17–19**: Test cases and AI feedback for clarity.
  - **Day 20**: Deploy and submit.

## UI/UX and Aesthetics
- **Visual Style**: Retro pixel-art detective office with animated web screens.
- **Interface**: Simple code editor with live preview and a chat window for AI hints.
- **Feedback**: Visual (e.g., glowing clues) and audio (e.g., detective music) cues reward progress.

## AI Craft
- The AI partner uses Claude to explain coding concepts (e.g., “Use `display: flex` to align those divs!”).
- AI adapts hints to player errors, enhancing learning.

## Judging Criteria Alignment
- **Learning Impact**: Teaches HTML/CSS with measurable progress (Clue Points, unlocked cases).
- **Gameplay & Engagement**: Detective theme and coding challenges keep players hooked.
- **Aesthetics & Feel**: Polished pixel-art visuals and smooth interactions.
- **AI Craft**: Creative use of AI for coding education.

## Why It Stands Out
CodeBuster makes HTML/CSS learning fun by framing it as detective work, a fresh and accessible approach. The pixel-art aesthetic and AI partner add charm, and the project is simple to build within 20 days using Bolt.new and React for the editor.
