## 🧠 AI Intelligence Features

### **Context-Aware Analysis**
The AI understands:
- Which case the user is solving
- Current HTML and CSS content
- What the user is trying to achieve
- Common mistakes and best practices
- Modern web development standards

### **Educational Responses**
Instead of just saying "add flexbox", the AI explains:
```
🎯 For centering elements: Modern CSS uses flexbox for alignment! 

**For horizontal centering:**
```css
.your-element {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

**Why this matters**: Flexbox is more reliable than float or text-align for layout!

**Quick way**: Click "Smart Snippets" → "flex-center" for instant perfect alignment! ⚡
```

### **Smart Snippet Integration**
The AI actively recommends Smart Snippets:
- "Use Smart Snippet 'nav' to fix this automatically!"
- "Try the 'flex-center' snippet for modern layout!"
- "The 'button-modern' snippet has amazing hover effects!"

const [highlightedLine, setHighlightedLine] = useState<{line: number, language: 'html'|'css'} | null>(null);
const [currentSuggestions, setCurrentSuggestions] = useState<CodeSuggestion[]>([]);
```

### **Real-time Analysis**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  analyzeCode(); // Triggered on every code change
}, [currentHtml, currentCss, caseId]);
```

### **Smart Hint Generation**
```typescript
// Case-specific analysis with line precision
htmlLines.forEach((line, index) => {
  if (line.trim().includes('<div class="navigation">')) {
    suggestions.push({
      line: index + 1,
      language: 'html',
      issue: 'Non-semantic navigation element',
      solution: 'Replace <div> with <nav> tag for better accessibility',
      example: `<nav class="navigation">...</nav>`
