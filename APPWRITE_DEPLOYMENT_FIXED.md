# 🚀 Fixed Vite Config - Ready for Appwrite Deployment

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Removed broken import** for `envReplacementPlugin`
2. **Clean Vite configuration** without unnecessary complexity
3. **Proper build settings** for Appwrite deployment
4. **All dependencies resolved** correctly

## 📁 Your Build is Ready

The `dist/` folder now contains a clean, deployable build:

```
dist/
├── index.html                    ✅ Clean HTML
├── assets/
│   ├── index-BRxix0Ur.js        ✅ Main app bundle
│   ├── firebase-vendor-*.js     ✅ Firebase bundle
│   ├── react-vendor-*.js        ✅ React bundle
│   ├── ui-vendor-*.js           ✅ UI components
│   └── monaco-vendor-*.js       ✅ Code editor
├── icons/                       ✅ App icons
└── manifest.json               ✅ PWA manifest
```

## 🚀 Deploy to Appwrite

### Method 1: Appwrite Console (Static Hosting)
1. Go to your Appwrite Console
2. Navigate to **Storage** → **Buckets**
3. Create a bucket for static hosting
4. Upload all files from `dist/` folder
5. Enable static website hosting

### Method 2: Appwrite Functions (Recommended)
1. Install Appwrite CLI: `npm install -g appwrite-cli`
2. Login: `appwrite login`
3. Create function:
```bash
appwrite functions create \
  --functionId=codecase-app \
  --name="CodeCase App" \
  --runtime=node-18.0
```
4. Deploy:
```bash
appwrite functions createDeployment \
  --functionId=codecase-app \
  --code="./dist" \
  --entrypoint="index.html"
```

### Method 3: Direct Upload
Simply upload the entire `dist/` folder contents to your Appwrite static hosting.

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Your app will use the environment variables from your `.env` file that were embedded during the build process.

## 🌐 Expected Result

Your site at `https://codecase.appwrite.network` should now:
- ✅ Load without module errors
- ✅ Have working authentication
- ✅ Connect to Firebase successfully
- ✅ Display all UI components properly

## 📝 Notes

- **Node polyfills**: Removed to simplify build
- **Environment plugin**: Removed problematic custom plugin
- **Clean build**: Standard Vite configuration for maximum compatibility

---

**Your deployment is now ready!** 🎉 The build errors are fixed and you can deploy to Appwrite.
